A Linux standard random generating process is different level sha process.
For standard software random device which is provided by kernel, it's generate
the random with sha function in kernel to get the data with given seed.
For openssl library, it do sha again with the data from the random device.

The TRNG will get the random data from the hardware directly, not do any
sha after we get the data.

It could be used as lowlevel random implemention easily.

1  Compilation

	./autogen.sh 

	./configure --prefix= CC= CFLAGS= --host= --with-kerneldir=

	make 

	make install 

2  Debug and Test

	./autogen.sh 

	./configure --prefix=$install_dir --with-kerneldir= --enable-debug --enable-examples --host=

	make 

	make install 
	
	cp $install_dir/bin/* $fs_dir/usr/bin 

	cp $install_dir/lib/*so* $fs_dir/usr/lib 

	compile the SDK 

	download the image to board 

	--------------------------------------------

	The following step is run in board terminal

	--------------------------------------------

3  Dependencies

	-pthread (examples)

	ali hdmi driver (src)

	ali tailed kernel (src)

4  Support OpenSSL

	To support OpenSSL, we just need to re-implement RAND_poll function with ALi
	random hardware to generate the random data which will used as the seed of 
	OpenSSL random engine from hardware.

5  PKG-CONFIG Command

	PKG_CONFIG_PATH=pkg-config

6  Notes

	It's threads safe and processes safe for wrapper APIs, but not safe for inner
	APIs. The application is recommended to call the wrapper APIs, or application
	have to guarantee to safety.
