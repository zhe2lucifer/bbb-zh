Descrambler is a function block for encrypt/decrypt data for security purpose. It provides
HW accelerator function for the Crypto, Hash, and Scramble/Descramble function. The Descrambler
could be used in the following secure purpose:
	(1) Data Encryption/Decryption
	(2) Data Hash digest generation
	(3) Message Signature Certification accelerater
	(4) TS Descrable
	(5) TS Scramble with specified key

With DMA and High performance Scrambl/Descramble Engine, this block could be used in the CA
application without external CAM module for multiple programs at the same time.
