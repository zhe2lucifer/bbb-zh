		How to Use ALi Platform Environment

/aliplatform         ----     Root of ALi platform environment
	/lib			 ----     Libraries directory
		/libxxx		 ----	  Sub libraries

2  Layer
2.1  Platform layer
	They're a series libraries named libalipltfxxx which provide basic
	system functionality such as log management to other library or
	application
2.2  Library layer
	They're a series libraries named libalislxxx which provide specific
	function to application
2.3  Platform library
	It's a library named libaliplatform.so which provide a integrated
	way to application for some specific usage such as initialize log
	for all module, etc.
2.4  Utils layer
	It's a series libraries and utilities which will be the base of
	the whole system user space running, such as window manager, etc.

4  Development
	For current structure, if you want to compile your module separately,
	and your module depends on another module. Due to we have bound the
	dependencies in the Makefile.am, you need to modify your Makefile.am
	of all LIBADD / LDADD parameter to resolve the dependencies, through
	CFLAGS / LDFLAGS or a directory of your dependency libraries.

5  Kernel Header
	Many device wrapper module need kernel header. You need to set CFLAGS
	for such module as: CFLAGS=-I${kerneldir}/include/ali_common, where
	kerneldir should be replaced by your own kernel directory.

6  Add a Module Unitest to Platform
	Add your unitest in to tests/platform/pltftest.c
	Solve all compile error
	Then compile the platform
	
	Then unitest should be also compile & run smoothly in the sub-module

	You have to copy the board configuration file "aliplatform_test_config.ini"
	to your program directory.

7  Cross Compile
	./autogen.sh
	./configure --prefix= CC= CXX= CFLAGS= (--enable-docs --enable-examples --enable-tests --enable-debug)
	make
	make install
