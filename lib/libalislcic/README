According DVB EN 50221, Set Top Box can connect with CAM (Conditional Access 
Module)card by DVB Common Interface for support conditional access and other 
extend application. The DVB Common Interface V1.0 is a PCMCIA based bus in 
physical layer, and we can use the CI controller (CIC) for our chipset to support
Common Interface.

The goal of designing CIC share library is to achieve HW independence of application
software.

As opposed to define a general-purpose, complete CI controller modular API interface
, we only define some common and necessary API. 

1  Compilation

	./autogen.sh 

	./configure --prefix= CC= CFLAGS= --host= 

	make 

	make install 

2  Debug and Test

	./autogen.sh 

	./configure --prefix=$install_dir CC= CFLAGS= --enable-debug --enable-examples --host= 

	make 

	make install 

	make html   (To generate documentation)
	
	cp $install_dir/bin/* $fs_dir/usr/bin 

	cp $install_dir/lib/*so* $fs_dir/usr/lib 

	compile the SDK 

	download the image to board 

	--------------------------------------------

	The following step is run in board terminal

3  Dependencies


4  Support Open Source Library


5  PKG-CONFIG Command

	PKG_CONFIG_PATH= pkg-config --libs "libalisltemplate"

6  Notes

	It's threads safe and processes safe for wrapper APIs, but not safe for inner
	APIs. The application is recommended to call the wrapper APIs, or application
	have to guarantee the safety.
