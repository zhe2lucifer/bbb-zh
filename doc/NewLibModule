		How to Add a New Module in Platform

1  Develop you module separatly
2  Put your module into lib directory
3  Add needed Makefile into top configure.in
4  Modify directory in your Makefile.am to relative value, 
   such as use $(srcdir) / $(builddir) / etc instead of 
   $(top_srcdir) / $(top_builddir) / etc.
5  Maintain your module's version in the Makefile.am which 
   will generate your share object
6  Maintain your module's document version and package name 
   in the Makefile.am which will generate your document
7  Add your module into lib/Makefile.am's SUBDIRS
8  Add BUILD_BYPLATFORM definition to your module's configure.in
9  Also maintain needed built in MACRO in your configure.in
	BUILD_DEBUG
	BUILD_EXAMPLES
	BUILD_DOCUMENT
	BUILD_TESTS
	ENABLE_DEBUG
10 Configure and compile aliplatform as any 3rd library you
   use

Notes:

1  To keep it to be simple, we don't pass the variables from 
   the top configure.in, but just let each module to maintain 
   its version and document package name internally.
