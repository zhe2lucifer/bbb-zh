The Crypto Engine is major used for secure KEY management, which includes:
	(1) Fetching secure key from OTP
	(2) 1/2/3-layer key ladder encryption/decryption
	(3) KEY/CW management
	(4) AES/3DES ECB 128bit mode

Crypto Engine can read secure key from OTP, the secure key must be put into level 0
registers/positions inside Crypto Engine, there has four level 0 registers/positions,
so it can load four secure key from OTP at the same time.

Crypto Engine support 1/2/3-layer key ladder decryption/encryption, it can generate a key into 
higher level registers by the lower level key, there has four levels registers inside the Crypto
Engine and the total number of the registers is 32.

Crypto Engine can support AES/3DES mode. The AES in Crypto Engine works in ECB mode and only
support 128bits KEY mode. The input and output data width of AES is 128 bit. The 3DES in Crypto
Engine works in ECB mode and support ABA 128bits KEY mode, the input and output data width of
DES is 64 bit.

5  Notes

	It's threads safe and processes safe for wrapper APIs, but not safe for inner
	APIs. The application is recommended to call the wrapper APIs, or application
	have to guarantee to safety.
